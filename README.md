# pc-scripts
Handy scripts used by the program committee for processing talk proposals.

These scripts were originally written by Rob Emanuele and used for talk proposals for FOSS4G 2016. 

To download csv data, save off PC credentials to the website in `~/.foss4g`, and use the `dl.py` (modified to your URLs).
Or, you can just manually download them.

report.py is the main "library" behind the other scripts.
There are lots of scripts that do things manually, for FOSS4G by the end mainly running qs.py was providing the main information, based on particular pc tags.
